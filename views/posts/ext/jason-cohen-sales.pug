  p Back in February 2010, Jason Cohen had an idea. A new Wordpress hosting service, that would help with speed, scalability, and security.
  p He now faced the challenge that everyone with a startup idea once faces:!{' '}
    span.italic How do I get my first customers
    | ?
  p Jason's approach was simple and brilliant. He logged onto Linkedin, searched for people who were consultants in Wordpress and sent them all the following email:

  h2 The results
  p Jason sent!{' '}

    |!{' '}of these emails.!{' '}
    span.bold 100%
    |!{' '}agreed to talk to him on the phone.!{' '}
    span.bold Not one

    span.bold 30
    |!{' '}verbally agreed to pay!{' '}
    span.bold $50 / mo
    |!{' '}once he’d built it.
  h2 Why does it work so well?
  p Well, Jason's email is a masterclass.
  p He puts himself in the consultant's shoes, shows respect for their time, and even calls out the elephant in the room - that the majority of these emails are just people trying to grab your time. Oh, and it's an!{' '}

    | .
  p But undoubtedly, the!{' '}
    span.bold killer line
    |!{' '}is Jason “offering to pay!{' '}
    span.bold whatever you think is fair
    |!{' '}for an hour of your time. Even if it’s more than your normal rate”. Why?
  p.list.list__top 1. It signals that he's not a time-waster.
  p.list 2. It signals that he is fair to do business with.
  p.list.list__bottom 3. And it's flattering (that he's willing to pay for your expertise).
  p These three reasons coalesce and the default response is:
  p.inwardSpeech Sure, let’s chat. You seem like a decent guy, so don’t worry about the money!
  h2 Summary
  p Today,!{' '}
    a(href="https://wpengine.com" target="_blank") WP Engine

    span.bold 500+ employees
    |!{' '}making in more than!{' '}
    span.bold $100M / yr
    | .
  p I bet they've still got people logging onto Linkedin, finding Wordpress consultants, sending similar emails, just like Jason did nine years earlier.
