  p Ask a marketer, “How does my product grow?” They'll reply:
  p.inwardSpeech Ads, affiliates, sales, social, yada yada yada
  p They’re describing top-down growth. Your classic funnel. Pour more in. Get more out. Here’s the problem.
  p.list.list__top • Funnels flow in one direction
  p.list • Inputs are tied to outputs
  p.list.list__bottom • Growth is linear
  //- p.list.list__bottom • Eventually you run out of inputs

  p Lets look at some examples.
  h2.under 1) Personal viral loop
  p Some products improve with more users. So there's a personal incentive to invite new users.

  h2.under 4) User generated content loop
  p Some products leverage users content to grow their own organic traffic.

    span.italic e.g. Quora, Reddit, Stack Overflow
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/gl4.png" alt="User generated content loop").img__100
  h2.under 5) Physical content loop
  p Some products attract new users simply by being noticeable. Lime's bright green is not a coincidence.
  //- p It's not a coincidence that Lime chose the brightest green they could find.

  //- p How can I apply this?
  p Most people think you build the product!{' '}
    span.bold then
    |!{' '}you market it. Thinking in loops means you build the marketing!{' '}
    span.bold into
    |!{' '}the product.
  p The product doesn't precede the marketing. The product!{' '}
    span.bold is
    |!{' '}the marketing.
