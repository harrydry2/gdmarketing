  p June 2019. I wrote my first marketing article. A year later my email list hit 19,000.
  p No ads. No connections. No existing audience.
  p The site grew because I learnt how to push my content round the internet.
  h2.under Here's the process
  p First, you find all the different places where your audience hangs out.

  p Then, ask yourself, “how can I add value!{' '}
    span.bold directly
    |!{' '}to these platforms?”
  p Adding value isn't dumping links. People are busy. You!{' '}
    span wow
    |!{' '}them on the platform they're!{' '}
    span.bold already
    |!{' '}using. Or you get ignored.
  p There's no “one-size-fits-all” formula. Twitter is not Facebook. You tailor your content to fit each platform.
  //- p Some platforms like long-form. Some short-form. Some images. Some text.

  p My strategy is simple. I share my whole article. Then, I politely ask if the reader would like to join my email list.

  p Facebook and Slack groups are a different ball game. Attention spans are shorter. Self-promoters get lynched.
  p I break my articles into visual tips. Subtly branding each one. Upfront value. No hard sell.

  //- p Finally, there's a bunch of sites (Hacker News, Designer News, Growth Hackers, Zest.is, etc ...) where you can post direct links. No secrets there. Although an upvote from a co-worker doesn't hurt.
