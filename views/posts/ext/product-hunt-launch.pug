  p Last Wednesday I launched Marketing Examples on!{' '}
    a(href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/marketing-examples-2" target="_blank") Product Hunt
    | . It received more than 1300 upvotes, was voted Product of the Week, and my email list zoomed from 1300 to 2900 in the space of 48 hours.

  p This is the step by step account of how I did it.
  h2 Step 1 - First 1000 fans
  p 23th May 2019 Marketing Examples v1.0 went live. The site had just a few case studies, several bugs and an email box which didn’t convert well. The old version of myself would have thrown it up on Product Hunt straight away. This would have given me a quick buzz and my first few email subscribers. But I decided to wait.
  p Firstly, it’s not every day you can launch on Product Hunt. I didn’t want to waste my “turn” with the very first iteration of my site.
  p Secondly, I didn’t want to launch in a vacuum.!{' '}
    span.bold Product Hunt multiplies current momentum
    | . Having a small following of “fans” who are happy to shout about your product on launch day goes a long way.
  p So I set myself a target.!{' '}
    span.bold 1000
    |!{' '}email subscribers and!{' '}
    span.bold 1000
    |!{' '}twitter followers. And then I could launch.!{' '}
    span.bold 65
    |!{' '}days later I reached that number. It was show time.
  h2 Step 2 - My goal
  p As I prepared for my launch I wanted clearly define what my goal was.
  p In the past I’ve fallen into the trap of using upvotes as my barometer of success. But when you think about it, upvotes are really just a!{' '}
    span.bold means to an end
    | . They are coupons you exchange for traffic. It’s what you do with that traffic which matters.
  p So, what is my goal? Well, I wanted to!{' '}
    span.bold maximise email subscribers
    | . So I spent the day before my launch making sure my site was in the best possible shape to collect emails. After all, 100 upvotes and 100 email sign ups is more valuable than 1000 upvotes and a site which can’t convert anyone.
  h2 Step 3 - My Post
  p Now I had the foundations in place it was time to schedule my post on Product Hunt. I chose!{' '}
    span.bold 12:01AM PST
    |!{' '}and!{' '}
    span.bold Wednesday 7th August
    |!{' '}(the very next day).  New products hit the homepage at midnight so this would give me the full 24hrs of exposure. And I’d also avoid the weekend traffic lull.
  p I filled in the description, added some images and my friend, Jana, made a nice GIF to help me stand out. Things were starting to take shape.
  video(src="https://harrydry.s3.amazonaws.com/gdmarketing/ph2.mp4" class="img__20" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted" loop="loop" playsinline="playsinline")
  p Next I began writing my first comment. This was my opportunity to connect with potential users. All going well, it would be read by several hundred people so I spent some time thinking about it.

  h2 Step 4 - Banner time
  p The next morning I woke up early, excited for what lay in store. The first thing I did was add a banner to my website. This would give anyone coming!{' '}
    span.bold directly
    |!{' '}to my site an easy route to support my launch.

  h2 Step 5 - Leverage your fans
  //- p Remember Step 1 where I built an initial audience. Well, this is the step where I leveraged that audience.
  p In holding fire for a few months I had earnt the luxury of an audience to share with. I tweeted from my!{' '}
    a(href="https://twitter.com/goodMarketingHQ") Marketing Examples account
    |!{' '}and also from my!{' '}
    a(href="https://twitter.com/harrydry") personal account
    | .

  p Product Hunt will use the!{' '}
    span.bold first image in your post
    |!{' '}as the meta image (the image everyone sees when you share on social media). People have a split second to decide whether to engage with the tweet or to scroll straight past and a great meta image can make all the difference.  So it’s worth putting effort into this one.
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/ph7b.jpg" alt="Marketing Examples Product Hunt Comment").img__75
  p Next, I started sharing with my email list. Beforehand, I clarified with Product Hunt that this was within their rules. They told me!{' '}
    span.bold it was
    | , but that!{' '}
    span.italic multiple new accounts signing up and voting one product in the same period of time may trigger our spam detection
    | .
  p So as a precaution I told subscribers to only support if they!{' '}
    span.italic already have a Product Hunt account
    | . I also split my email list into segments and scheduled emails!{' '}
    span.bold throughout the day
    |!{' '}to avoid a rush of upvotes in one go. And yes, I did use!{' '}
    a(href="https://emailoctopus.com?ref=marketingexamples") EmailOctopus
    | .
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/ph8.jpg" alt="Marketing Examples Product Hunt Comment").img__60
  p The results:
  p.list.list__top Emails Sent: 1345
  p.list Open Rate: 633 (47%)
  p.list.list__bottom Click to Product Hunt: 208 (15%)
  p This was enough firepower to get into the top 3 places.
  h2 Step 6 - Indie Hackers and Startup School
  p Next I posted on the Startup School forum and also added a Milestone to my Indie Hackers product page. These forums work well because both audiences are familiar with Product Hunt. Both posts sat at the very top for the whole day and drove considerable traffic to my launch.

  //- p Bear in mind, the following numbers are purely people being driven to!{' '}
  //-   span.bold my website
  //-   | . I'd expect a!{' '}
  //-   span.bold greater number
  //-   |!{' '}went directly to my Product Hunt post.
  p Why were my posts so well received? Well, I wasn’t just screaming, “Everyone look at me!” at the top of my voice. In my post, I included some tips on!{' '}
    span.italic how best to launch to Product Hunt
    | . And I think people appreciated that. The best way to get help is to offer help in return.

  h2 Step 7 - Telegram and Slack
  p There’s literally thousands of Telegram and Slack groups out there for startup folk: Bootstrappers, digital marketers, solo founders. You name it, there’s a dozen groups you can join.
  p These are are a great place to share your launch because of the huge crossover with the Product Hunt audience. I was a member of about 10 myself, so I started working through them one by one.
  p I quickly realised that the level of support I received was directly correlated to my level of contribution. In groups where I had helped others, others helped me and when I hadn’t put in the effort, well … I got ignored. Product Hunt launch is the day when your karma comes full circle.
  h2 Step 8 - Kick back
  p After sharing everywhere I wanted to share, I kicked back with a nice glass of water, and spent the rest of the day replying to comments, tweets, emails, just trying to be helpful.
  p Previously, I might have spent the day hunting down upvotes. Posting on Facebook, badgering friends, I remember once I even made an account on my Mums iPad. I can assure you this stuff does!{' '}
    span.bold more harm than good
    | . A high % of new (or previously inactive) accounts voting your product will see you banished from the front page.
  h2 Summary
  p And there we go. That's how Marketing Examples ended up with Product Hunt's!{' '}
    span.italic Product of the Week
    |. I don’t think there is a!{' '}
    span.italic right
    |!{' '}way to do it, but I do think that there’s some basic principles, that if you follow you can’t go far wrong:
  p.list.list__top 1. Build an audience before you launch.
  p.list 2. Don’t celebrate upvotes, celebrate conversions.
  p.list 3. Support others and karma will come back round
  p.list.list__bottom 4. Don't overshare
