  p Pieter Thiel spends 6 months writing down everything he knows about business. His book sells for!{' '}
    span.bold $10
    |!{' '}on Amazon.
  p Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger spend 6 months writing down everything they know about design. Their “book” sells for!{' '}
    span.bold $149
    |!{' '}online.
  p Believe it or not, both these prices make perfect sense.
  p Thiel is selling to the!{' '}
    span.bold masses
    |!{' '}and the masses are!{' '}
    span.bold price elastic
    |!{' '}(sensitive to price increases). If he raises the price to $30 his audience wouldn’t think twice before substituting his book for one of the many cheaper alternatives on Amazon.
  p Adam and Steve are selling to an audience of!{' '}
    span.bold hardcore
    |!{' '}fans. Hardcore fans are!{' '}
    span.bold price inelastic
    |!{' '}(insensitive to changes in price).
  p They've all been following the twitter tips, watching the screencasts, reading the Medium Posts. In their minds, there are no substitute resources available. They don’t want any old design book, they want a!{' '}

    |!{' '}design book.
  p When demand for your good is inelastic, you raise your price. As the illustrative diagram shows, a!{' '}
    span.bold 10x
    |!{' '}price increase (from $15 to $150) results in just a!{' '}
    span.bold 2x
    |!{' '}drop in books sold (20k to 10k) and!{' '}
    span.bold 5x
    |!{' '}more revenue.

  h2 Step 2 - Escape the context of an e-book
  p So quite rightly Adam and Steve elected to charge a high price, but that created one problem:!{' '}
    span.italic You can't just sell an e-book for $100+
    | . People are anchored to what they're used to paying on Amazon. To quote Adam:
  p.inwardSpeech The
    |!{' '}format commands the price. No matter what the content is. That's why a lot of people are selling courses these days instead of books, because you can put the exact same information in a course, and people will be like, “Oh but it’s a course. So I’ll pay $200 for a course”.
  p So how did Adam and Steve get around this? Well, they set up their own website, added in video tutorials, an icon pack, color palettes, font recommendations, a component library. And then!{' '}
    span.bold the context changed
    | .
  p They were no longer selling an!{' '}
    span.italic Amazon e-book
    |, they were selling an!{' '}
    span.italic exhaustive design package
    | . And they could charge whatever they liked.
  h2 Step 3 - A Gateway Lower Tier
  p Originally Refactoring UI was set to release at just one flat price of $149. That was the price Adam and Steve wanted people to pay. But after several complaints, they decided to introduce a lower tier of $79. Not only did this stop the complaints, I'll bet it also made them considerably more money.
  p Firstly, there's an odd psychological effect where people don't mind paying more as long as they believe they’re doing it on their own terms. To quote Adam:
  p.inwardSpeech If you give people the choice to pay you less when they pay you more they did it because they!{' '}
    span.bold decided to
    |!{' '}not because they were!{' '}
    span.bold forced to
    | . And I think that had an effect.
  p Secondly, it's not easy for someone to justify a $149 purchase outright. I think it’s easier to justify $79 and then be persuaded to upgrade from $79 to $149.
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/rui2a.png" alt="AndCo Cold Email").img__70
  p Essentially, the lower tier allows the mind to commit to the purchase. And then!{' '}
    span.italic once committed
    |!{' '}the higher tier is packaged in such a way that it would be irrational to not go with it.
  h2 Step 4 - A persuasive higher tier
  p Firstly, look at the!{' '}
    span.bold hierarchy
    |!{' '}of the two packages. The $149 package takes up twice as much screen space, the font size is larger, and the button color is primary. It doesn't feel right pressing the “Buy Now” button on the lower tier.
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/rui4.png" alt="Refactoring UI: Pricing Tiers").img__100
  p Secondly, look at the disproportionately sized discounts. The!{' '}
    span.italic Complete Package
    |!{' '}is reduced by!{' '}
    span.bold 40%
    |!{' '}(or $100) and!{' '}
    span.italic The Essentials
    |!{' '}is only reduced by!{' '}
    span.bold 25%
    |!{' '}(or $20). To quote Adam:
  p.inwardSpeech If you want people to buy the more valuable package why not make the discount more compelling than the other one.
  p And finally, just look at the names of the packages. Labelling the higher pricing tier!{' '}
    span.italic The Complete Package
    |!{' '}infers that in choosing anything less you're missing out. It could just as accurately be labelled!{' '}
    span.italic The Bonus Package
    |!{' '}but that wouldn't have the same psychological impact.
  h2 Results
  p And the subtle tweaks in the packaging of the two tiers seemed to work. In spite of initial complaints about the price of the!{' '}
    span.bold 6765
    |!{' '}total purchases,!{' '}
    soan.bold 78%
    |!{' '}favoured the higher tier (as of Jan 10, 2019).
  h2 Summary
  p And there we have it.
