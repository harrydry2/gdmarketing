  p September 2011, Ryan Cohen and Michael Day dropped out of college to pursue their online pet food startup, Chewy.
  p They tried to raise money, but investors weren't interested. Apparently Amazon was!{' '}

  p Five years later, Chewy overtook Amazon as the biggest online pet food retailer in America. One year later it was acquired for £3.5bn.

  p For example, if you call Amazon's customer service to complain you're told to “file a dispute”. If you call Chewy's customer service you're told:
  p.inwardSpeech Don’t worry about returns, we’ll refund you, just donate the item to a pet shelter
  //- p I’m aware this is a cliche, so let me share  run timeline of a real Chewy customer:
  p That's the tip of the iceberg. Every Chewy customer is welcomed with a handwritten card reminding them to call anytime:

  p They employ 100 artists whose sole job is to paint and post portraits of customers pets.

  p And, If they hear about a pet passing away, they'll send a bouquet of flowers and a condolence note:

  p The!{' '}

    span.bold Firstly
    //- |, pet food is a recurring purchase. One customer might last 50 years. It pays to delight customers when their lifetime value is high.
