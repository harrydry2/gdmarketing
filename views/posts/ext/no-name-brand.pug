  p no name is a “no nonsense, no frills” supermarket brand in Canada.
  p Nothing special. A lot of discount brands share these “values”. But they all communicate them through similar slogans, packaging, and comparison ads.
  p So no name went the other way. What happens if you strip away all the fancy-dress from a brand? You're left with the bare bones. Stark simplicity.
  p The packaging is lowercase Helvetica over a yellow background. The website says “website”. The Twitter page says “twitter page”. Their sole ad campaign of the last decade saw them matter-of-factly label Toronto’s subway station:

  h2.under What can we learn from no name?
  p The first lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold separation
    | .
  p To quote Ted Morgan, “positioning is like finding a seat on a crowded bus”.
  p Most brands walk on the bus, glance left, glance right, and end up sitting on top of each other. no name marched straight up to the top deck, found an empty seat, painted it yellow, and no one else can sit there.
  p You escape competition through separation.
  p The second lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold limitation
    | .
  p Limitation is the essence of branding.
  p no name’s focus is singular. They don’t pretend to be lots of different things. They stand for something simple and narrow:!{' '}
    span.italic The rejection of superficiality
    | .
  p The final lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold consistency
    | .
  p Once you know what you stand for consistency is how you imprint yourself. Consistent tone, Consistent aesthetics. Consistent messaging.
  p no name tells the same joke over and over again, and it gets better every time. It reminds me of a running gag on!{' '}

  //- p  — “Apologies to Matt Damon, we ran out of time”.
  p The first time you're unsure, the 50th time it’s the best thing in the world. That's the power of consistency:
