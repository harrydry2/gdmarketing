p Last week Molly-Mae did an!{' '}
  a(href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CE7P2L8F42o/" target="_blank") Instagram giveaway
  | . She spent £8k on gifts.
p So far it's returned:
p.list.list__top • 270k new YouTube subscribers
p.list • 210k new Instagram followers
p.list.list__bottom • 550k new followers of her brand,!{' '}

p That's < 1p / fan. Possibly the best ROI I've seen. Let's break it down:

p The most important thing Molly-Mae did was time her giveaway with reaching 1M YouTube subscribers.
p This gave it!{' '}
  span.italic purpose
  | .
p It wasn't just an attempt to get some new followers. It was a!{' '}
  span.italic celebration
  | . And people got behind her.

p Next, let's look at the specifics.
p Molly-Mae asked followers to “like and tag”. She also offered bonus entries for “multiple tags” or if users shared the post to their stories.
p Each one created a mini viral loop which helped the post spread.
p And it worked. Her post got 1.9M comments (1900x her average).

p So the giveaway exploded. To the point where it was becoming a meme. Boys started sarcastically offering girls £5 to!{' '}
  span.italic not

p The easy thing would be to not respond. But Molly did. And her self-awareness took ownership of the joke.

p Finally, let's talk results.
p The aim of most giveaways is to grow the account hosting the giveaway.
p But the problem is the people you’re targeting!{' '}
  span.italic already follow you
  | . It would be like running an ad!{' '}
  span.italic to your followers
  |!{' '}asking them!{' '}
  span.italic to follow you.
p Molly-Mae realised giveaways are more effective at converting existing followers!{' '}
  |!{' '}to!{' '}
  span.italic new platforms.
p She prioritised YouTube and her brand,!{' '}

  | . And managed to pull 820k across!

p Okay. Last thing. Yes, it’s well-executed. But for £8k the return is still insane.
p Molly-Mae's!{' '}
  span.italic personal brand
  |!{' '}is what makes the difference.
p If a fashion brand runs the same giveaway the numbers don't compare.
p We don't celebrate!{' '}
  span.italic brands
  | . We celebrate!{' '}
  span.italic individuals
