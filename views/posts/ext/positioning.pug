  p I love this line by Ted Morgan.
  p.inwardSpeech Positioning is like finding a seat on a crowded bus
  p Most brands sleepwalk onto the bus and sit on top of one another.
  p The smart brands look left, right, find an empty row, paint their logo on it and start singing sweetly like the Sirens.

  p Positioning is an easy thing to complicate so let's keep it simple.
  p.inwardSpeech Your goal is to!{' '}
    span own a space in the customer’s mind
    | . You do this by!{' '}
    span differentiating yourself
    | .
  p Differentiation is not a dark art. It's something you can learn. Here’s how you can achieve it.
  //- p Let's run through all the different ways brands achieve this.
  h2.under 1/ Through contrast
  p Point at the status quo and pit yourself against it. Contrast burns your brand into the customer's mind.

  h2.under 2/ Through values
  p Think Patagonia and the environment, Ben and Jerry's and social justice, Black Rifle Coffee and gun rights.
  p Some will hate it. Others will rally behind you. And!{' '}

  h2.under 3/ Through category creation
  p Invent a new category and you haven't got any competitors.
  p When Drift launched in 2016 they were just!{' '}
    span.italic another
    |!{' '}startup in the mushy bucket of live chat software. How to stand out?
  p Well, they reframed live chat as!{' '}

  h2.under 4/ Through personality
  p Productize yourself. Competitors can’t copy the!{' '}
    span.italic you
    |!{' '}in your product.
  p Think Kanye’s shoes, Nigella's cookbook, Wicks’s workout.
  //- p Turn yourself into the product and no one can compete with you.

  h2.under 5/ Through limitation
  p Instead of trying to be!{' '}

  p Writing this made me think back to how I positioned Marketing Examples.
  //- p.list.list__top • Contrast - Marketing content is full of fluff. My goal is zero fluff.
  p.list.list__top • Contrast - Marketing content was fluffy. My goal was no fluff
  p.list • Personality - Well, I write them all
  p.list.list__bottom • Limitation - Just examples. No agency, jobs board, etc...
  //- p The brands which own a space in the mind are both simple and narrow.

  h2.under One last thing
  p Positioning isn't something you make up on a whim.
  p Behind great positioning is a story. Positioning is the one line summary. The story makes it memorable.
  p Look at Drift.!{' '}
