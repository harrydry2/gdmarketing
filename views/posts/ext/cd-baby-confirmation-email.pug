  p I’m sure a few of you have heard this story. But it’s worth telling again for those who haven’t.
  p Back in 1998, when!{' '}
    a(href="https://sivers.org/") Derek Sivers
    |!{' '}first founded!{' '}
    a(href="https://cdbaby.com/") CD Baby
    | , their order confirmation email was the regular: “Your order has shipped today. Thank you for your business.”
  p But for Derek, this generic email felt at odds with CD Baby’s mission of putting smiles on faces. So he spent 20 minutes writing up the following:

  p Not only did it succeed in putting smiles on faces, people were so enamoured that they flocked to music forums and personal blogs to share the email. This led to discussion after discussion about CD Baby as well as hundreds of valuable backlinks.
  p In fact, if you run an exact search on Google for “private CD Baby jet,” you’ll get just over 2000 search results. That’s how many different sites have copied out Derek’s email.
  p There’s no lever quite like an army of fans shouting about your business for you. Companies like to think a “better product” is always the answer. As we've seen, however, 20 minutes of creative writing can be just as effective. To quote Derek:
  p.inwardSpeech When you’re thinking of how to make your business bigger, it’s tempting to try to think all the big thoughts and come up with world-changing massive-action plans. But please know that it’s often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you.
