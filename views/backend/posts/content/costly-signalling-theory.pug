h2 The girl in the foyer
p Let‚Äôs start with a story. Last month I was on the train going to Wembley to watch a football match. On jump a bunch of lads. It sounded like they worked for a marketing agency.
p.inwardSpeech Did you hear about that 16-year-old in the office today, boys?
p.inwardSpeech No, what happened?
p.inwardSpeech So I get into work this morning. And there‚Äôs this young girl hovering in the foyer. She‚Äôs not talking to anyone, just sort of standing there looking a bit lost. I assumed she was someone‚Äôs kid or something so I walked past.
p.inwardSpeech Anyway, 30 minutes later I pop out for a smoke and she‚Äôs still there, hovering. So I walk over to her and ask her if she needs a hand with anything. And now she‚Äôs looking really nervous, but she looks up at me and says, ‚ÄúI really like some of your companies marketing campaigns‚Äù. And then she starts listing all our campaigns off.
p.inwardSpeech I start smiling and she starts to relax a bit. She tells me that she‚Äôs at school at the moment but in her spare time she‚Äôs reading marketing books and if there was any chance she could do some work experience in the summer.
p.inwardSpeech ‚ÄúFair play!‚Äù one of the lads' chimes in. ‚ÄúThat takes balls‚Äù says another. ‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt do any work experience‚Äù, says the third.
p.inwardSpeech I know. But I talked to Cav and we‚Äôre going to make an exception!
h2 Costly signalling theory
p This is costly signalling theory in action.
p That girl could have delivered the&nbsp;
  span.bold exact same message
  |&nbsp;(except more eloquently) in the form of an email. And yet, it would have got her nowhere. It's impossible to signal seriousness via email because the cost of delivery is so negligible.
p Only in putting herself through the stomach-wrenching ordeal of walking into a big and scary office, and daring to ask for work experience face to face was she able to signal that&nbsp;
  span.bold she really cared
  | . It's a pretty safe bet that she's not going to arrive late and browse Facebook all day.
p To quote&nbsp;
  a(href="https://twitter.com/rorysutherland" target="_blank") Rory Sutherland
  |:
p.inwardSpeech The meaning and significance we attach to something is felt in direct proportion to the expense with which it is communicated
p Imagine you see two letters in your mailbox. One is mailed by 20p stamp and the other by Fedex. Which one do you open first?
p Essentially,&nbsp;
  span.bold costliness carries meaning
  | . The handwritten card carries more meaning than an email. The Michelin Star meal carries more meaning than a takeaway. Asking a girl out face to face carries more meaning than over Tinder.

p And awareness of this principle is invaluable in understanding the psychology of marketing.

p You want to get a job with Kanye West. Rent billboards worldwide saying ‚ÄúHire me Kanye West‚Äù.

p In every instance the&nbsp;
  span.bold extra effort taken increases the perceived value of the communication
  | .
p.inwardSpeech Bloody hell, if they [sent a pigeon, made a video, hired a billboard] then it must be important.
h2 nod of appreciation
p A lot of the ideas in this case study are taken from Rory Sutherland's book,&nbsp;

  | . Would certainly recommend it.
