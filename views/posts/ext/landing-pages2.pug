  p Landing pages are simple. I’ve made hundreds. It was my old job, then I did it for clients.
  p When I started I was clueless. Throwing shapes on a page and crossing my fingers. But after a few dozen I found a formula that converted. Here it is:
  p.list.list__top 1/ Explain the value you provide!{' '}
    span.italic (title)
  p.list 2/ Explain how you'll create it!{' '}
    span.italic (subtitle)
  p.list 3/ Let the user visualise it!{' '}
    span.italic (image)
  p.list 4/ Make it believable!{' '}
    span.italic (social proof)
  p.list.list__bottom 5/ Make taking the next step easy!{' '}
    span.italic (CTA)

  p Let's go into on each component.
  h2.slab.bg1 1/ Title
  p There’s 50 ways to write a great title. The majority fall into two categories.
  p
    span.bold 1/ Value + Hook
  p
    span.italic Explain the value you provide. Add a hook to make it more appetising. There’s two ways to write hooks:
  p.inwardSpeech a) Ask “what can we say about our product that no-one else can?” That’s your hook.
  span.isBreak
  p.inwardSpeech b) Ask, “what's stopping people buying?”. Address this objection. That’s your hook.
  //- p.inwardSpeech b) Indentify your customer's biggest buying objection. Address it. That’s your hook.
  //- p
  //-   span.bold 2/ One line summary
  //- p
  //-   span.italic The goal is to own your niche in one line. The trick is conviction. Write like you’ve got no competitors.
  //- p
  //-   span.italic Boil what you do into a line so powerful you don’t need a hook. The goal is to own your niche. Write like you’ve got no competitors.
  p
    span.bold 2/ Own your niche
  p
    span.italic Boil what you do into a line so powerful you don’t need a hook. The trick is conviction. Write like you’ve got no competitors.
  //- p.inwardSpeech • Don’t say “We help” say “It's how”.<br>• Don’t say “A” say “The”.
  h2.slab.bg2 2/ Subtitle
  p Good subtitles do two things:
  p.list.list__top a) Introduce the product
  p.list.list__bottom b) Explain!{' '}
    span.bold how
    |!{' '}it creates the value in your title

  h2.slab.bg4 3/ Image
  p Your image is your chance to show off your product. Don’t waste it with stock images or illustrations.

  p Show off your product. Make me want it. Don’t rely on stock images or illustrations.
  h2.slab.bg3 4/ Social Proof
  p Good social proof shows credibility. Great social proof inspires action.
  p It's not “a box to be ticked”. It's an opportunity to sell your product. Think!{' '}

    mark.ss1 real words

  h2.slab.bg5 5/ CTA
  p The role of the CTA is to make taking the next step easy.
  p Most buttons amplify action:!{' '}
    span.italic Sign Up, Start Trial etc.
    |!{' '} They're clear, but not compelling. Here's 3 more persuasive button types.
  //- Lon
  p
    span.bold 1/ Call to value
  p.inwardSpeech Fulfils!{' '}
    span.bold the value
    |!{' '}promised in your title. Buttons which emphasise “value” over “action” usually perform better.
  //- p.inwardSpeech Emphasises “value” over “action”.
  p
    span.bold 2/ Remove friction
  p.inwardSpeech Use the second half of the button to handle an objection. E.g. “I bet this takes ages” ⟶ “with one click”
  p.inwardSpeech Add a few words to the CTA to entice the user to click.
  p
    span.bold 3/ CTA + Email capture
