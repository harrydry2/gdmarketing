  p Last week I asked people on!{' '}
    a(href="https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1316053333463969792") social media
    |!{' '}to submit their websites and I’d rewrite them
    | .
  //- p I wanted to make it awesome. So I asked!{' '}
  //-   a(href="https://anniemaguire.com/" target="_blank") Annie Maguire
  //-   | , the best copywriter in the business, for help.
  p I wanted to make it awesome. So I drafted in!{' '}
    a(href="https://anniemaguire.com/" target="_blank") Annie Maguire
    | , one of the best copywriters in the business.
  p The idea is to give you an insight into!{' '}
    span.italic how the mind of a pro copywriter works
    | !
  h2.under 1) JobBoardSheet
  p Their current copy is!{' '}
    span.italic clear
    | . But it's also!{' '}
    span.italic forgetful
    | . So I looked down their page and found this new line.
  p It handles the customer's!{' '}
    span.italic four main objections in one sentence
    | . Bravo!

  h2.under 2) Silva
  p Firstly, “Trail Runner Free” is VERY confusing. Is that the product? Is the product free? Are trail runners' free?
  p Also, there's no!{' '}
    span.italic emotional pull
    | . A new headlamp is fairly boring. So I'd rather sell the!{' '}
    span.italic the adventure
    | . And tie the headlamp to that!

  p Most customers are buying!{' '}
    span.italic outcomes
    |!{' '} not!{' '}
    span.italic products
    | . So this one's about shifting the emphasis to reflect that. What's more appealing:

  //- p This one's more about!{' '}
  //-   span.italic presentation
  //-   |!{' '}than!{' '}
  //-   span.italic copywriting
  //-   | . You can't expect people to read one huge text block to understand your product.
  //- p So I simplified their title into a short sentence. And added an image to help visualise it.
  p This one's more about!{' '}
    span.italic repackaging
    |!{' '}than!{' '}
    span.italic rewriting
    | . You can't expect people to read one huge text block to understand your product.
  p So I condensed their text block into!{' '}
    span.italic one
    |!{' '}sentence. And added an image to help visualise the product.

  h2.under 5) Ladybird driving school
  p Ladybird's uniqueness is that!{' '}
    span.italic all their instructors are female
    | . So don't bury it half way down your page. Lead with it. Loud and proud!
  p
    span.italic Write the title only you can

  h2.under 6) Banquist
  p Banquist is a unique product. But they waste their uniqueness with a vague title that could mean fifty different things.
  p All I've done is write out their value prop out as clearly as possible.!{' '}
    span.italic Let great products speak for themselves

  //- p So I fell back on!{' '}
  //-   span.italic WHAT
  //-   |!{' '}for!{' '}
  //-   span.italic WHO
  //-   |. And then got specific in the subtitle.
  p This one was all over the place. “Know more. Collaborate faster...” is meaningless. And the title assumes I've heard of “Collective Defense”.
  p So I went with a broader mission statement. Then got specific in the subtitle.

  p No one cares what you can do. Everyone cares what you can do
    span.italic for them
    | .
  p Kids don't care about “the next generation of SAT prep”. They care about “Acing the SAT”.
  p I also pulled up the $1 trial. And made the “five stars” feel REALER.
  //- p Also... the $1 trial is enticing. So I pulled it up. I also made the “five stars” feel REALER.

  p “Fan tokens”, “exclusive surveys”, “rewards”. It's all peripheral.
  p Get to the real problem. Fans are!{' '}
