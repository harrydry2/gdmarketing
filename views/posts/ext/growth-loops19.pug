  h2.under 7) Embedded loop
  p.asterix * * *
  h2.under So there you go
  p Think loops not funnels. Compound over linear. Long-term over short-term.
  p Don't ask, where shall I !{' '}
    span.italic pour resources
    | .
  p Ask, how I can create loops which
    span.italic leveraging existing customers
    | .
  p Think less about!{' '}
    span.italic pouring in inputs
    | . More about!{' '}
    span.italic leveraging existing customers
  //- p Instead of asking which channel shall pour more resources into.
  //- p Ask,
