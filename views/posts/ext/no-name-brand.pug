    a(href="") no name
    |!{' '}is a “no nonsense, no frills” supermarket brand in Canada.
  p Nothing special. A lot of supermarket brands share these “values”. The hard part is communicating them in a way that people remember.
  p Most discount brands try and persuade people with slogans, packaging, and comparison ads. But that's hardly “no-frills”.
  p  So no name went the other way. What happens if you strip away all the fancy-dress from a brand? You're left with the bare bones. Stark simplicity.
  p The packaging is lowercase Helvetica over a yellow background. The website says “website”. The Twitter page says “twitter page”. Their sole ad campaign of the last decade saw them matter-of-factly label Toronto’s subway station:
  //- p What matters is how you communicate your values. It's not enough to tell people who you are. You have to say it in a way that gets people's attention.
  //- p The hard part is communicating your “values” in a way that people remember them. And this is where no name excels.
  //- p Most discount brands run ads showing savings or slap “20% extra free” on their packaging. no name goes the other way.

  //- p Show me another supermarket brand that could post a picture of their biscuits on Twitter and get 6,000 likes. Or launch a new line of beer that sells out in 48 hours. Or have their customers demand merchandise.
  h2.under What can we learn from no name?
  //- p no name’s execution can’t be copied. But their approach to brand building can be.
  p The first lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold limitation
    | .
  p Limitation is the essence of branding.
  p no name’s focus is singular. They don’t pretend to be lots of different things. They stand for something simple and narrow:!{' '}
    span.italic The rejection of superficialty
    | .
  p The second lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold consistency
    | .
  p Once you know what you stand for consistency is how you imprint yourself. Consistent tone, Consistent aesthetics. Consistent messaging.
  p no name tells the same joke over and over again, and it gets better every time. It reminds me of a running gag on!{' '}

  //- p  — “Apologies to Matt Damon, we ran out of time”.
  p The first time you're unsure, the 50th time it’s the best thing in the world. That's the power of consistency.

  p The final lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold separation
    | .
  p To quote Ted Morgan, “positioning is like finding a seat on a crowded bus”.
  p Most brands walk on the bus, glance left, glance right, and end up sitting on top of each other. no name marched straight up to the top deck, found an empty seat, painted it yellow, and now, no-one else can sit there.
  p You escape competition through separation.
