  p Let’s start in 2017.
  p Andrew Schulz had been killing in the New York comedy clubs for over a decade. But no network would give him a shot.
  p So he spent $30k filming his own special. And handed it to the networks on a plate.
  p
    span.italic They still said no.
  //- p 3 years later he's built!{' '}
  //-   span his own
  //-   |!{' '}media empire. And is one of the most watched comics on the planet. This is his story.

  p Schulz realised he was going to have to make it alone. So he started analysing how people!{' '}
    span.italic actually
    |!{' '}watch comedy.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom I asked all my friends about different specials and they all said the same thing, “Yeah, it was good. But I didn’t finish it.”
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top I realised the hour is too long.
  p So Schulz cut his special down to 16 minutes and put it on YouTube.

  p He had some subscribers from years of podcasting there. It started getting traction.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom YouTube was working. So I started treating my channel like my own network.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top There was this rapper, Russ, who put out a song a week for a year. So I started putting out a joke a week.
  p With every joke his channel grew. But coming up with new comedy every week wasn't sustainable.
  p Schulz's solution was to hone his improv. Because roasting the crowd meant new content every night.

  //- p He'd film every show. Hoping to get one electric clip for YouTube.
  //- p For most comics a new 5 minutes is a month's work. Schulz could get that in one night.
  //- p And throughout 2019 he put out!{' '}
  //-   span.bold 89
  //-   |!{' '}bits of live comedy.
  p He started filming every show. Sometimes 7 in one weekend. Hoping to get one electric clip for YouTube.

  p Through 2018/19 Schulz uploaded 117 bits of live comedy. And his channel grew from 140k to 840k.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom The key was making my content digestible.
  p.inwardSpeech.letter Nobody wants to listen to a stranger do comedy for an hour. But you'll listen to a 2 minute clip if a friend sent it to you.
  //- Opt 3
  //- p For Schulz YouTube is all about aquiring new fans. 100 clips is 100 different access points. And they're shareable.

  p March 2020. Schulz was midway through his first worldwide tour. Then Coronavirus hit.
  p Most comedians were screwed. Schulz adapted. He built a home studio and started doing!{' '}
    span.italic Late Night
    |!{' '}style monologues.
  p Except, the jokes weren't watered down to please network execs. Schulz was unfiltered. And people resonated.

  //- p.inwardSpeech Who's cancelling me? The problem with Late Night is you know the joke before they tell it. There’s no surprise.
  //- op2
  //- p For instance, contrast a “network” joke about Joe Biden with a Schulz one.

  p Another thing Schulz nailed was distribution. He!{' '}

  p Schulz put out 17 monologues in 17 weeks. Averaging 2M views across YouTube and Instagram. That's more than the comedy networks who had ignored him for 5 years.
  p.asterix * * *
  p Schulz’s story isn’t about comedy. It’s a lesson for anyone wanting to do anything.
  p When the gatekeepers don't let you in,!{' '}
    span.italic start your own thing
    | . Package it in a way that's easy to consume. Then keep going until you've got momentum. The problem is most people can’t suffer that long.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom If you see someone on the side of the road with their car broken down. You drive by.
  p.inwardSpeech.letter But if you see somebody pushing their own car. You stop and help.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top I was an entitled little f***ing brat whining about not having a special. I helped myself then people helped me.
