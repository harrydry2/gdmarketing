  h2.h2start What are long-tail keywords?
  p
    a(href="https://www.wordtracker.com/academy/keyword-research/guides/long-tail-keywords" target="_blank") Long-tail keywords
    |&nbsp;are keyword phrases typically made up of three or more words. They are the least competitive keyword phrases to rank for and hence great to drive organic traffic to your website.
  p For example whilst it would be highly improbable that someone starting a new cookery blog could rank for “pancake recipe” (short tail / too competitive), it is possible that they could rank for “blueberry pancake recipe” (long tail / less competitive).
  h2 What is Nomad List
  p
    a(href="https://nomadlist.com" target="_blank") Nomad List
    |&nbsp;is a crowdsourced database aggregating the best cities for Digital Nomads to live or work in remotely. You can filter these cities by hundreds of different data points. For example air quality, cost of living, racism, etc …
  p As you start adding filters, the database of cities is queried and the home page dynamically updates to display the best matching city.&nbsp;

  h2 Long Tail SEO Magic
  p Crucially, the results of each filter query are also housed on their&nbsp;
    span.bold own url
    | . An autogenerated page kitted out with meta tags, h1, etc …
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/nl2.jpg" alt="JS Tut").img__90
  p Once you aggregate all combinations of filters together, we’re talking several thousand indexed pages hoovering up organic traffic from long tail keyword phrases.
  p Take the keyword, “least racist states” as an example. A reasonably easy keyword to rank well for which pulls in 1,200 organic searches per month.

  p Type the result into Google and guess who’s number 1:
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/nl4.png" alt="JS Tut").img__80
  p An autogenerated page created by combining two Nomad List filters: “Low in Racism” + “North America”. And this page&nbsp;
    span.bold is not just
    |&nbsp;picking up traffic from that solitary keyword. It ranks for well over a hundred similar keywords such as “top ten racist states”, “least racist city” etc…
  h2 Really long tail
  p Stitching together two more filters: “Fast Internet” + “Near Beach” into a keyword phrase you start to get a feel for the sheer volume of Nomad List pages indexed by Google.

  h2 Organic Search Traffic
  p But as you can see the majority of Nomad List's organic search traffic simply comes from aggregating city data across various countries and autogenerating /country pages.
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/nl3a.png" alt="JS Tut").img__90
  p And then using targetting the longtail keyword phrase:&nbsp;
  p.inwardSpeech best cities to live in ...
  p with an h1 tag.

  h2 Summary
  p The genius of Nomad Lists approach is in recognising that they already have the valuable data at their fingertips to dominate hundreds of longer tail keywords and all that’s left to do auto generate the page based off the same PHP template.
  p Contrast this with a 99% of other companies who have no option but to research and write blog posts&nbsp;
    span.bold one by one
    | &nbsp;to compete with Nomad List for the same longer tail keywords.
  h2 How to replicate this?
  p Essentially, all that's going on is your just bundling useful content under unqiue url's.
  p With this very website for instance, every single filter (as well as being used to query the home page) is also&nbsp;
    span.bold its own
    | &nbsp;unique page as well. For example:
  p.list.list__top
    a(href="https://marketingexamples.com/viral" target="_blank") marketingexamples.com/viral
  p.list.list__bottom
    a(href="https://marketingexamples.com/coldemail" target="_blank") marketingexamples.com/coldemail
  p are both pages in their own right. This means:
  p.list.list__top 1. More pages to be indexed by google
  p.list 2. More longer tail keywords to rank for
  p.list.list__bottom 3. More organic traffic
