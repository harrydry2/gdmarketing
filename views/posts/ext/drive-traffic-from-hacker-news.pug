  p For those of you who don’t know,&nbsp;
    a(href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank") Hacker News
    |&nbsp;is a news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. If you’re on the hunt for some geeky landing page traffic there is few places you’d rather be on the front page of.
  p Last month my story about&nbsp;
    a(href="https://marketingexamples.com/direct/how-nike-sold-first-shoes").italic How Nike sold its first shoes
    |&nbsp;made it and the traffic spike is … pretty ridiculous.

  p In spite of this success, I’ll be the first to admit that I am pretty clueless when it comes to Hacker News. I throw up my blog posts, cross my fingers, and nine times out of ten times end up feeling dejected.
  p So in putting together this case study I needed to learn from the experts.
  h2 Introducing Adriaan Van Rossum
  p
    a(href="https://twitter.com/adriaanvrossum") Adriaan
    |!{' '}runs a privacy focused analytics platform called!{' '}
    a(href="https://simpleanalytics.com/?ref=marketingexamples.com" target="_blank") Simple Analytics
    | .
  p Since he launched 9 months ago Hacker News has been the&nbsp;
    span.bold number one
    |&nbsp;source of traffic to both his main site and blog. We’re talking more than&nbsp;
    span.bold 30,000
    |&nbsp;total visits. A staggering&nbsp;
    span.bold 60%
    |&nbsp;of total traffic.

  p How is he driving so much traffic from Hacker News?
  p Well, fortunately all Simple Analytics traffic is!{' '}
    a(href="https://simpleanalytics.com/simpleanalytics.com/?start=2018-09-14&end=2019-07-27" target="_blank") open
    |!{' '}so it was possible to compare traffic spikes with Adriaan’s Hacker News activity and!{' '}
    span.bold figure it out
    | .
  img(src="https://harrydry.s3.amazonaws.com/gdmarketing/sa3.png", alt="Tweet Photo Before and After").img__100
  p What follows is everything I've learnt from Adriaan condensed into five simple lessons.
  h2 Lesson 1 - How to write a Hacker News title
  //- p Traditionally, marketers are rewarded for writing titles which lure you into clicking them. On Hacker News, it's the complete opposite. In fact, the more you try and stand out the more you guarantee that you will be ignored.
  p Traditionally, marketers are rewarded for writing titles that lure the Homer Simpson archetype into clicking. On Hacker News, you are rewarded for writing titles that lure the Professor Frink archetype into clicking.
  p Here are a couple of Adriaan's titles:
  p.list.italic.list__top 1. I made a privacy-first minimalist Google Analytics - !{' '}
    a(href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19526521") 968 points
  p.list.list__bottom 2. We moved our servers to Iceland - !{' '}
    a(href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19526521") 241 points
  p They are matter-of-fact, unemotional and understated. And that’s what works best. You want to bleed out all the superfluousness.
  p Arguably the most famous Hacker News post of all time is titled!{' '}
    a(href="" class="italic") I sell onions on the internet
    | . If it was titled,!{' '}
    span.italic You won’t believe these 5 crazy reasons why I sell onions online
    |!{' '}I'm not sure it would have got the same attention.
    //- | . All the superfluousness has been bled out.
  //- p I’m sure these titles would be rejected by content marketers. But that’s how you know you’re onto a winner. After all, they’d probably try and rewrite the legendary HN title,!{' '}
  //-   span.italic I sell onions on the internet, to
  //- p.inwardSpeech You won’t believe these 5 crazy reasons why I sell onions online
  h2 Lesson 2 - Comments are underappeciated
  p On Hacker News, comments:!{' '}
  p.list.list__top a) Can get!{' '}
    span.bold several thousands
    |!{' '} of views.!{' '}
  p.list.list__bottom b) Allow!{' '}
    span.bold clickable links
    |!{' '} to be included (unlike text posts).
  p This makes them a great alcove for self-promotion. How do you write the perfect comment? Well, Adriann's reply to someone who made a simple log-based analytics tool is the textbook example:
  img(src="https://harrydry.s3.amazonaws.com/gdmarketing/sa5.png", alt="Tweet Photo Before and After").img__95
  p To summarise the steps:
  p.list.list__top 1. Lookout for a post on the front page relevant to your domain
  p.list 2. Offers some thoughtful advice
  p.list.list__bottom 3. Subtly drops in your own product
  p The result:!{' '}
    span.bold 590
    |!{' '}Hacker News users check out his website.
  h2 Lesson 3 - Questions are underappeciated
  p Just like writing!{' '}
    span.bold thoughtful comments
    |!{' '}is an under-appreciated form of marketing, so is asking!{' '}
    span.bold thoughtful questions
    | .
  p Questions work because they're an easy way to engage people. Again, Adriaan provides the textbook example.
  p He asks what questions he should put to Facebook at an upcoming privacy roundtable. This title gets people's attention, and then in the body of the post he drops a subtle link to Simple Analytics and his twitter handle.
  img(src="https://harrydry.s3.amazonaws.com/gdmarketing/sa4.png", alt="Tweet Photo Before and After").img__95
  p The result:!{' '}
    span.bold 500
    |!{' '}Hacker News users on his website and!{' '}
    span.bold 100
    |!{' '}more twitter followers.
  //- p I asked Adriaan about this example and he told me the key was!{' '}
  //-   span.bold creating relevancy
  //-   |!{' '}between the question and what you want to promote. For example, you can't just drop a link to your Twitter handle out the blue. But if you say,!{' '}
  //-   span.italic Facebook invited me because I've been heavily critical of them on Twitter
  //-   |, you!{' '}
  //-   span.bold create relevancy
  //-   | . And you get away with linking it.
  h2 Lesson 4 - Create Relevancy
  p I asked Adriaan about his successes asking questions and posting comments. He told me the key was in making sure anything you link is !{' '}
    span.bold relevant
    |. And if it's not relevant well then ...!{' '}
    span.italic you make it relevant
    | .
  p For example, you can't just drop a link to your website or Twitter handle out the blue. But if you say,!{' '}
    span.italic I was invited me because I've been heavily critical of them on Twitter
    |, you!{' '}
    span.bold create relevancy
    | . And then you can link to your hearts content.
  p Just remember to link the HN way with [1] [2]. This shows you know the platform. It also puts your links in a more prominent position.
  //- p The formula is exactly the same with writing comments:
  //- p.list.list__top 1. Think up a question relevant to your product
  //- p.list 2. Spend 90% of the question offering value
  //- p.list.list__bottom 3. Subtly drop in own product.
  h2 Lesson 4 - Rig the lottery
  p There’s close to 1000 submissions every day on Hacker News. This means no matter how amazing your creation there’s a good chance it will go completely unnoticed.
  p My friend David learned this the hard way last month. He built, “
    a(href="https://www.crowdform.co.uk/hntv/live" target="_blank") A 24/7 TV station
    |&nbsp;made up from the best Hacker News videos”. We both thought it was a shoe-in with the Hacker News audience. It didn’t get one single upvote.
  p How can you turn the odds in your favour?
  p Well, it’s tricky. Hacker News isn’t at all like Product Hunt.&nbsp;
    span.bold Upvotes do not count from anyone who arrives at your post via direct link
    | . This basically means that people have to find and upvote your post organically from the /newest page.
  p What I’ve noticed Adriaan do is put out a tweet directing people to the /newest page with a big arrow pointing to his post.
  img(src="https://harrydry.s3.amazonaws.com/gdmarketing/sa6.jpg", alt="Tweet Photo Before and After").img__95
  p This might only buy one or two upvotes. But on Hacker News, one or two upvotes is often all it takes to ignite the spark.
  h2 Lesson 5 - Launch tips
  p Adriaan knows a thing or two about launching on Hacker News. His post launching Simple Analytics was one of the most upvoted of last year. This is largely down to having a great product, but when I asked Adriaan he sprinkled on a few launch tips which are perhaps less obvious:
  p.list.list__top 1. Always post to the!{' '}
    a(href="https://news.ycombinator.com/show" target="_blank") Show HN
    |!{' '}page. The lower frequency of posts means you will have more chance of being seen than of the default home page.
  p.list.list__top 2. Post a good first comment. Adriaan likes to reference a technical hurdle and then show how he solved it. This gives the HN community some meat to get their teeth into.
  img(src="https://harrydry.s3.amazonaws.com/gdmarketing/sa9.png", alt="Tweet Photo Before and After").img__85
  h2 Power of HN
  p The power of Hacker News is it provides the opportunity for massive leverage. Choose the correct title and your startup is projected to thousands. Write the right comment and you can make 20 sales.
  p And it's that disconnect between your inputs and your outputs which make it such a good opportunity for a marketer.
  //- p Content marketing, at it's least creative, is a profession where your inputs are closely tied to your outputs. For every new Facebook group you spam your blog in, you can assume another 5 - 10 people might click on it.
  //- p Hacker News excites me as a marketer, because it is a tool where your inputs and outputs are not closely tied together.
  h2 Summary
  p So there we have it. 9 months.
