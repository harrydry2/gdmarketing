  p Failed musicians think like failed startups. Too much time creating. Not enough time promoting.
  p When Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue music he didn’t create much. Instead he lived on Twitter, made online friends and got popular posting memes. His account quickly grew to 30,000 followers.
  p The plan was to use his following to promote his music. But it wasn’t that simple. In Nas’ words:
  p.inwardSpeech I’d post a funny meme and get 2,000 retweets. Then I’d post a song and get 10.
  p So Nas got creative. He stopped tweeting SoundCloud links and started writing a song he could promote through memes. In his words:

  p The video went viral. So Nas stuck to this formula: Short viral videos. To the tune of Old Town Road. Full song linked underneath.
  p As an unknown artist it was the only way he could get the word out. And the views started piling up:

    |!{' '}into a national talking point and two weeks later it was No. 1.
  p Nas made the most of having the hottest song in the world and began recording remixes with some of musics biggest stars.
  p Billboard has a loophole whereby remix plays count towards the original song's chart placement. When one remix waned, a new version would come out. And!{' '}
    span.italic Old Town Road
    |!{' '}became impossible to budge.
  p 17 weeks later he'd broke Mariah Carey’s record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1.
  p It’s easy to forget quite what an extraordinary story this is. Five months earlier, Nas was a college dropout sleeping on his sister’s couch with a negative balance in his Wells Fargo account.

  //- p As I researched the story I was waiting for the moment where Nas benefits from some freakish good fortune. But it didn’t come.
  p On my first day researching Old Town Road I read a quote from Nas:
  p.inwardSpeech A lot of people like to say “a kid accidentally got lucky”. No. This was no accident. I pushed this hard.
  p The more I learnt about Nas the more I believed him. Let me finish with this story:
  p A key moment in Nas' rise was a video of a man standing on a galloping horse spreading round Twitter. The audio was set to Old Town Road. Countless versions of this video were viewed millions of times.

  p I wanted to know how the video first spread, so I did some digging, and found it first posted on the 24th December:

  p I asked “motiv8” why he made the video. He told me Nas sent it to him.
  p So Nas was behind this video taking off. But it doesn't end there.
