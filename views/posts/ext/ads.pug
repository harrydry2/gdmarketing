  p My dad runs a small!{' '}

  //- p Up until last year the only marketing they did was sending flyers to schools — their target market. But, over time, flyers had lost their effectiveness, so my dad started thinking about running digital ads.
  p It's an old school business. Up until last year the only marketing he's ever done was sending flyers to schools. But, flyers had stopped working so well, so he started thinking about running digital ads.
  //- p But flyers had stopped working so well, so my dad started thinking about digital ads.
  //- p He began recording testimonials with teachers and putting them out as Facebook ads. The ads looked solid but the return wasn’t great.
  p One of his friends was raving about Facebook. So he began recording testimonials with teachers and putting them out as Facebook ads:

  p The ads looked solid but the return was poor. I mentioned that he should try out other ad platforms. Instead, he went deeper into Facebook.
  p He watched YouTube videos, signed up for webinars, and even bought an online course. The ROI slowly improved, but it still was far from cost effective. To a worm in horseradish the world is horseradish.
  //- p Dad remained adamant Facebook would come good.

  //- p The ROI slowly improved. It was still far from cost-effective, but it was better than flyers.
  //- p A month later I went on a walk with him. He was telling me about more ideas for new Facebook campaigns:

  //- p I went on a walk with him a month later. He was telling me about yet another idea for a new Facebook campaign:
  p “How do you know Facebook is!{' '}
    span.italic the best
    |!{' '}way of getting in front of teachers?” I asked him.
  p “Err, what do you mean?”
  //- p “Well, imagine you're on a quest to make the perfect bowl of soup. You don't try and finesse one recipe straight away. First, you experiment with lots of different flavours. Then, only when you know what works, do you perfect it.

  //- p “Imagine you're a caveman on a quest to make the perfect stew. You don't try and finesse one recipe straight away. First, you experiment with lots of different ingrediants: plants, bark, oxtail ... Then, only when you knows what works, do you start perfecting it.
  //- p “Imagine mum set you a challenge to make her the perfect bowl of soup. You wouldn't spend six months finessing one recipe. First, you'd experiment with lots of different flavours. And then, only when you know which one she likes best, do you start perfecting it. Right now, you're making fifty different types of pea soup. Mum hates peas!”

  //- p To Dad's credit he took my advice onboard. He started testing ads on Twitter, Google, and even sponsored a teachers conference.
  p It took a while for my soup analogy to sink in. But to his credit, a few months later he was testing ads on Twitter, Google, and he even sponsored a teachers conference.
  p The Google ads completely bombed. His first attempt on Twitter smashed six months of “perfecting” on Facebook. But, the conference was the biggest success. In just one day it pulled in more than a months revenue. The worm's head was well and truly out the horseradish:

  //- p And I'm proud. This is a fifty-eight year old man with an old brick for a phone, who thinks “emojis” are a Caribbean fruit. He sat on YouTube, taught himself how to run different types of ads, and is doing a better job than most agencies. If he can do it, so can you.
  h2.under The moral of the story
  //- p.asterix * * *
  p The moral of the story is not that “Sponsoring a conference > Twitter ads > Facebook ads > Google ads”. There is no “best” way to advertise. Every product is different. Every audience is different.
  //- p There is no “best” platform to advertise. Every product is different. Every audience is different.
  //- p In my dad's case it turns out that Twitter and conferences are more effective at getting a message to teachers than Facebook. But how would he know that without experimenting.
  p Let go of certainty. A little knowledge was my dad's achilles heel. Any marketer tied to preconceptions will spend six months going from “A” to “B”.
  p Try lots of quick experiments with different platforms. When you find what works, hone it. The pattern to replicate is:
  p  - - - - - | - - - - | - | - - - - - | - - - - - - | - - - -
  p where a dash represents a!{' '}
    span.bold small loss
    |!{' '}and a straight line represents a!{' '}
    span.bold new discovery
    | . That’s how you make the perfect bowl of soup.

  p When running ads you want to make sure you're measuring!{' '}

  //- p A conversion is someone buying your product. A click just means they've hit your landing page.
  p Facebook would consistently drive the cheapest clicks to my dad's site. But it wasn’t the right type of “click”. Only measuring conversions did we realise how few were interested in buying.
