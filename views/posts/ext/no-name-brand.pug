  p no name is a ‚Äúno nonsense, no frills‚Äù supermarket brand in Canada.
  p Nothing special. A lot of discount brands share these ‚Äúvalues‚Äù.
  p But they all communicate them through similar slogans, packaging, and comparison ads.
  //- p But competition leads to copy-catting, and they all communicate them through similar slogans, packaging, and comparison ads.

  //- p no name is a ‚Äúno nonsense, no frills‚Äù supermarket brand in Canada.
  //- p Nothing special. A lot of discount brands share similar ‚Äúvalues‚Äù. And they all rely on fancy slogans, packaging, and cost-saving ads to communicate them.
  //- p But that's hardly ‚Äúno-frills‚Äù. All that jazz is designed to persuade.
  //- p _________________________________________________
  p no name tried something completely different. What happens if you strip away all the fancy-dress from a brand? You're left with the bare bones. Stark simplicity.
  p The packaging is lowercase Helvetica over a yellow background. The website says ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù. The Twitter page says ‚Äútwitter page‚Äù. Their sole ad campaign of the last decade saw them matter-of-factly label Toronto‚Äôs subway station:
  //- p What matters is how you communicate your values. It's not enough to tell people who you are. You have to say it in a way that gets people's attention.
  //- p The hard part is communicating your ‚Äúvalues‚Äù in a way that people remember them. And this is where no name excels.
  //- p Most discount brands run ads showing savings or slap ‚Äú20% extra free‚Äù on their packaging. no name goes the other way.

  h2.under What can we learn from no name?
  p The first lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold separation
    | .
  p To quote Ted Morgan, ‚Äúpositioning is like finding a seat on a crowded bus‚Äù.
  p Most brands walk on the bus, glance left, glance right, and end up sitting on top of each other. no name marched straight up to the top deck, found an empty seat, painted it yellow, and no one else can sit there.
  p You escape competition through separation.
  p The second lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold limitation
    | .
  p Limitation is the essence of branding.
  p no name‚Äôs focus is singular. They don‚Äôt pretend to be lots of different things. They stand for something simple and narrow:!{' '}
    span.italic The rejection of superficiality
    | .
  p The final lesson is!{' '}
    span.bold consistency
    | .
  p Once you know what you stand for consistency is how you imprint yourself. Consistent tone, Consistent aesthetics. Consistent messaging.
  p no name tells the same joke over and over again, and it gets better every time. It reminds me of a running gag on!{' '}
