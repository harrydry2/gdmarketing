p In this example, the absurdity of the opening paragraph and dog picture is enough to put a smile on your face and critically&nbsp;

p I'm also a fan of asking the recipient to score their “current payroll provider” before going into the pitch.

p I do think the CTA could be improved here, however. Requesting a “quick conversation” is a bit vague. There's no additional information on how to instigate that conversation. Adding something like:
p.inwardSpeech I'm around all next week, so feel free to give me a call on +44 7463 686533 ...
p would be an improvement. When cold emailing you need to make the CTA as&nbsp;
