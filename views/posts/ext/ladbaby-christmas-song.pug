    span.italic how to start a movement
    | . Let me share some lessons.
  h2.slab.bg1 1/ Start with a compelling story

  p It turns them from!{' '}

  h2.slab.bg2 2/ Make something shareable
  //- p Viral content is the perfect blend of accessibility with absurdity.
  p So they had a story. Now they needed a song.
  p Instead of coming up with something original Mark and Rox wrote sausage roll parodies of famous songs.
  p Clever for two reasons: The familiar tune makes it accessible. The sausage roll theme adds meme potential. And people couldn't stop sharing.
  //- p Clever for two reasons: The familiar tune makes it easy to sing along. The sausage roll adds meme potential.
  //- p Familiar enough to be relatable. Original enough to be shared. That's the viral formula.
  //- p Content which goes viral is both easily accessible and completely absurd.

  h2.slab.bg3 3/ Bring people on the journey
  //- p So each year Mark and Rox launch their song Friday morning. And then vlog the entire Christmas No.1 week on YouTube.
  p So each year Mark and Rox launch their song. And then vlog their entire Christmas No.1 attempt on YouTube.
  p The vlogs aren't anything fancy. Just 2 minutes on an iPhone with something silly to promote the song.
  p But they're raw. And you get swept up in their journey.
  //- p So each year Mark and Rox launch their song. vlog the entire Christmas No.1 week on YouTube.
  //- p It's reality TV.

  h2.slab.bg4 4/ Galvanize followers
  p The great thing about bringing people on the journey with you is they'll help you bring even more people.
  p Mark's the king of this. Watch how he motivates his followers to get #LadBaby trending on Twitter. All perfectly timed for their song launch.
  //- p Watch how he leverages his followers to get himself trending on Twitter. Hundreds of thousands of clicks, perfectly timed for their song launch.

  h2.slab.bg5 5/ Know what turns the needle
  p Momentum or not, there's no way Mark and Rox can outstream Mariah Carey.
  //- p Viral is just potential energy. The question is what you can do with it.
  //- p Because they can't outstream Mariah Carey.
  p Here’s where it gets tactical. The way the UK charts are calculated 1 paid download equals 100 streams.
  p So Mark and Rox focus exclusively on downloads. Every vlog, radio, TV appearance is as mini-adverts to download the track.
  p Based on streaming numbers alone they don’t make the charts. But the sheer number of downloads makes them pretty much untouchable.
