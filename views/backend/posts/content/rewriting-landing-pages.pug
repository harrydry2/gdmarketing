p Last week I asked people on!{' '}
  a(href="https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1316053333463969792") social media
  |!{' '}to “submit your company landing page” and I’d rewrite it.
p Well, we did it! I teamed up with!{' '}
  a(href="https://anniemaguire.com/" target="_blank") Annie Maguire
  | , one of the best copywriters in the business.
p Hopefully this gives you an insight into!{' '}
  span.italic the mind
  |!{' '}of a pro copywriter.

p Put yourself in the customer's shoes. Kids don't care about “the next generation of SAT prep”. They care about “Acing the SAT”.
p We also pulled up the $1 trial. And made the “five stars” feel REALER.
h2.under 2) Banquist
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie2.jpg" alt="Banquist landing page copywriting").img__100
p Banquist is a unique product. But they waste their uniqueness with a vague title that could mean fifty different things.
p When you've got a unique product the golden rule is to!{' '}
  span.italic let the product speak for itself
  | .
h2.under 3) Dormio
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie6b.png" alt="Dormio landing page").img__100
p Customers' buy!{' '}
  span.italic outcomes
  |!{' '} not!{' '}
  span.italic products
  | . What's more appealing:
p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom a) A calming tea
p.inwardSpeech.list__top b) A calming tea that helps you relax, unwind, and drift into deep, restorative sleep
h2.under 4) JobBoardSheet
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie1a.png" alt="JobBoardSheet landing page").img__100
p Their current copy is!{' '}
  span.italic clear
  | . But it's also!{' '}
  span.italic forgettable
  | . So we looked down their page and found this new line.
p It's much more specific. And handles the customer's!{' '}
  span.italic four main objections in one sentence
  | .
h2.under 5) Silva
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie3.png" alt="Silva landing page").img__100
p Firstly, “Trail Runner Free” is very confusing. Is that the product? Is it free?
p Also, there's no!{' '}
  span emotional pull. People don't get excited by a new!{' '}
  span.italic headlamp
  | . They get excited by new!{' '}
  span.italic adventures
  | . So sell the latter.
h2.under 6) Socios
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie9a.png" alt="Socios landing page copywriting").img__100
p Football fans don't care about “tokens”, “surveys”, and “rewards”.
p Take ownership of the!{' '}
  span.italic real problem
  | . Fans are crying out to have their voices heard. Socios solves this. So own it.
p Also, add social proof. You're literally working with Barcelona!
h2.under 7) Counterweight Creative
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie10.png" alt="Counterweight Creative landing page").img__100.
p This one had promise. But the language is too vague. It doesn't feel REAL.
p We replaced all their!{' '}
  span.italic vague
  |!{' '}words with!{' '}
  span.italic specific
  |!{' '}ones. You can't bullshit specifics.
h2.under 8) Haako
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie5.png" alt="Haako copywriting").img__100
p This one's more about!{' '}
  span.italic repackaging
  |!{' '}than!{' '}
  span.italic rewriting
  | . You can't expect people to read one huge text block to understand your product.
p So we condensed their text block to!{' '}
  span.italic one sentence
  |. And added an image to bring the product to life.
h2.under 9) Ladybird driving school
img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/annie4.png" alt="Ladybird driving school landing page").img__100
p Ladybird's uniqueness is that!{' '}
  span.italic all their instructors are female
  | . So don't bury it half-way down the page. Lead with it.
p
  span.italic Write the title only you can
  | .
