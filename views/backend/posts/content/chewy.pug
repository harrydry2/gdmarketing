p September 2011, Ryan Cohen and Michael Day dropped out of college to pursue their online pet food startup, Chewy.
p They tried to raise money, but investors weren't interested. Apparently Amazon was!{' '}
  span.italic already established in the market
  | .
p Five years later, Chewy overtook Amazon as the biggest online pet food retailer in America.
p Chewy wasn't cheaper. They didn't sell special pet food. There was no!{' '}

  | . The difference was!{' '}
  span.bold customer service
  | . Where Amazon was faceless, Chewy treated customers like family.
//- p For example, if you call Amazon's customer service to complain you're told to “file a dispute”. If you call Chewy's customer service you're told:
//- p.inwardSpeech Don’t worry about returns, we’ll refund you, just donate the item to a pet shelter
//- p I’m aware this is a cliche, so let me share  run timeline of a real Chewy customer:
p Every customer is welcomed with a handwritten card reminding them to call anytime:

p They employ 100 artists whose sole job is to paint customers' pets. The portraits are then mailed to unsuspecting customers:

p If they hear about a pet passing away, they'll send a bouquet of flowers and a condolence note:

p And if you buy the wrong dog food, customer service will tell you:
p.inwardSpeech Don’t worry about returning it, we’ll refund you, just donate the item to a pet shelter
h2.under The customer service multiplier
p Delighting customers is expensive. Not every company should be hiring artists and sending flowers. Why does it work for Chewy?
p
  span.bold Firstly
  |, pet food is a recurring purchase. One customer might spend $70,000 on dog food over a lifetime. It pays to delight customers when their lifetime value is high.
p
  span.bold Secondly
  | , people love to share pet-related content. Each day social media is littered with Chewy’s portraits. It pays to delight customers when they're likely to broadcast their delight.
p
  span.bold Finally
  |, in certain sensitive markets (e.g., education, healthcare, pets), people make buying decisions based on who cares most. And Chewy's customer service shows they care.
p It's this combination of high lifetime value, high sharing coefficient and customers who care which make Chewy's customer service efforts so effective.
p.inwardSpeech The!{' '}
  span multiplier effect
  |!{' '}of delighting your customers is contextual on the marketplace.
p You can’t set up an online kitchenware store and outcompete Amazon with better customer service. The customer service multiplier just isn't big enough.
