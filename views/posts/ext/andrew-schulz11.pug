  p Let’s start in 2017.
  p Andrew Schulz had been killing in the New York comedy clubs for over a decade. But no network would give him a shot.
  p So he filmed his own special. And handed it to the networks on a plate.
  p
    span.italic They still said no.

  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom I asked all my friends about different specials and they all said the same thing, “Yeah, it was good. But I didn’t finish it.”
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top I realised the hour is too long.
  //- p.inwardSpeech.list__top People weren’t watching Chappelle for an hour. So there was no way they were going to watch me for an hour.

  //- p.inwardSpeech.list__top I realised it was too long. People weren't even watching Chappelle for an hour.
  p So Schulz cut his special down to 16 minutes and put it on YouTube.
  //- p He already had 100k subscribers from years of podcasting on YouTube. So he put it out there and it started taking off.

  p He had some subscribers from years of podcasting there. And it started getting traction.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom YouTube was working. So I started treating my channel like my own network.
  //- p monday, tuesday, and then at the weekend he'd put out live comedy.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top There was this rapper, Russ, who put out a song a week for a year. I thought I'll put out a joke a week for a year.
  p And in 2018 that's what he did. In 2019 he upped it to!{' '}
    span.bold 89
    |!{' '}clips of live comedy.
  p For a comedian this is unheard of. Schulz's improv ability made it possible. Roasting the crowd was scalable.
  p He’d film every show. Sometimes 7 in one weekend. Just hoping to get one electric clip for YouTube.
  //- p.inwardSpeech One time I was roasting this guy in the front row. It turned out he’d went to prison for murder. That clip got 2M view.

  //- p For Schulz YouTube is all about aquiring new fans. 100 clips is 100 different access points. And they're shareable.
  p Through 2018/19 Schulz uploaded 117 bits of live comedy. Contrast this with the comedian who puts out one special every year.
  //- p For Schulz YouTube is all about!{' '}

  //-   | . 100 short clips is 100 different access points. And they're shareable.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top 100’s of clips on YouTube is 100’s of different access points. One hour on Netflix is one access point.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top And nobody wants to listen to a stranger for an hour. But you'll listen to a 2 minute bit if a friend sent it to you.
  p And 2 minutes is enough to take someone down the wormhole.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom We realised people would watch one clip. Then they’d watch for two hours. So Netflix can’t get you to watch one hour. But people are watching two hours on YouTube.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top I figured it’s because “you made the choice”. It’s like hitting snooze on the alarm. “Another 5 minutes… Another 5 minutes…”
  p Two years of grinding Schulz's YouTube grew from 140k to 840k. He’d went from not selling out clubs. To selling out theatres worldwide.

  p March 2020. Schulz was midway through his first worldwide tour. Coronavirus hit. His tour was cancelled.
  //- p By 2020 Schulz was flying. Then coronavirus hit. His tour was cancelled.
  //- p Most comedians were screwed. Schulz adapted. He built a home studio and started doing!{' '}

  //- p Except, it was real comedy. Schulz wasn't shackled by network execs.
  //- p.inwardSpeech Who's cancelling me? The problem with Late Night is you know the joke before they tell it. There’s no surprise.
  //- p e.g. Compare a “network” joke about Biden with a Schulz one.

  p Another thing Schulz nailed was distribution. He didn't spam YouTube links across social media. Instead he!{' '}

  p 17 weeks of monologues later, Schulz truly exploded.
  p His monologues average more views than the majority of Late Night monologues.
  //- p Schulz’s story isn’t about comedy. It’s a lesson for anyone wanting to do anything.
  //- p Forget the noun, do the verb. Fail until it works. And if you keep going long enough it will work out. Most people can’t suffer that long.
  //- p.inwardSpeech You see someone on the side of the road with their car broken down. Nobody stops. But if you see somebody pushing their own car. You always stop. Because their helping themselves.
  //- p Penguin didn't hand James Clear a book deal. He built a newsletter to 250k subscribers.
  //- p Juventus didn't hand Sarri the managers job. He worked his way up from the 8th tier of Italian football.

  p There's a story Andrew tells which sums it up:
  p.inwardSpeech.list__bottom If you see someone on the side of the road with their car broken down. You drive by.
  p.inwardSpeech.list__top But if you see somebody pushing their own car. You stop and help.
  p A week later Joe Rogan invited him onto his podcast.
