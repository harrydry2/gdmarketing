  p For any popular product there’s always a bunch of people who are unhappy or who want to compare alternatives.
  p Often they’ll Google “[Product] alternative” where [Product] is the current product they’re familiar with.
  p If you’re a competitor, one nice trick is creating a comparison page targeting this search term. For example EmailOctopus have a “
    a(href="https://emailoctopus.com/mailchimp-alternative" target="_blank") Mailchimp alternative
    | ” page.

    a(href="https://podia.com/?ref=marketingexamples" target="_blank") Podia
    | , the online course platform, nails this strategy. Let’s run through it:
  h2 A hub of pages
  p The first area where Podia excels is search volume.
  p Once the first “[Competitor] alternative” page is built the marginal cost of adding another is minimal. Podia certainly make the most of this. In total they have!{' '}
    span.bold 37
    |!{' '}pages (all variations of the same template) pulling in!{' '}
    span.bold 5,500
    |!{' '}organic traffic / mo:

  p No matter which competitor becomes “the next big thing” Podia’s “alternative” page is ready to pinch any unhappy customers.
  h2 Targeted Copy
  p The beauty of “alternative” pages is they allow you to position yourself as the!{' '}
    span.bold antidote to your competitors pain
    | . Podia’s doesn't miss an opportunity:
  p 1. For every competitor page Podia's header copy hits at the heart of why someone might want to migrate:

  p 2. The categories in their comparison table are handpicked (from a much larger pool) to best highlight eachcompetitors deficiencies.
  p 3. Even their testimonials are targeted. For instance the “Gumroad alternative” page showcases customers who previously left Gumroad:

  h2 Intercom Popup Trick
  p On viewing one of Podia's “alternative” pages an Intercom pop up appears with a little message reading:
  p.inwardSpeech Hey! 😊 Quick question: are you currently using [Competitor]?
  p This is a great way to get a dialogue flowing. It turns a landing page visit into a sales interaction. I bet Spencer is well versed on each competitors pain points.

  h2 Defend Territory
  p Podia have also built a “Podia Alternative” page themselves where they compare the competition. Given this page is on Podia’s domain it’s sure to come in at No 1 for the “Podia Alternative” search term.
  p This prevents competitors creating “Podia Alternative” pages, strolling to the top of Google, and pinching their customers.
  p _______________________
  p And finally, Podia are just as good in defense as attack.

  p.list 2). Duplicate for all competitors
  p.list 3) Position yourself as the antidote to your competitors pain
  p.list 4) Use a messaging plugin to engage in conversation
