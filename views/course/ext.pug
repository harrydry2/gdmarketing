    p.first Hey, I'm Harry.
    p Two years ago I started writing marketing case studies. People liked them. So I left my job and went full-time.
    p Since then, they've been read by more than!{' '}
      span.italic one million people
      | . Which...!{' '}
      span.italic is freaking mind blowing
      | !
    p I'm spending the next six months working on a practical course for marketers and entrepreneurs.
    p It’s!{' '}
      span.bold everything you need to grow your business
      | . Or more precisely,!{' '}
      span.italic exactly how I’d help you grow if you hired me.
    p Before we get into it let me remind you what growth looks like.
    p.inwardSpeech You!{' '}

      span.ccHigh.thc2 convert

      |!{' '}customers. You create loops so customers!{' '}
      span.ccHigh.thc4 refer
      |!{' '}more leads.
    p.last Now, each module relates to one of these stages. Here's the outline:

    p.first Let’s go into the details.
    p.header.thc1 1/ Content & SEO
    p
      span.italic How to build a modern day media company
    p First, I'm going to show you how to come up with a content strategy: Picking channels, standing out, distribution, tailoring, etc.
    p Then, I'm going to share!{' '}
      span.bold specific growth guides
      |!{' '}for!{' '}
      spam.italic Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, newsletters, podcasts, SEO

    p.header.thc1 2/ Paid ads

      span.italic How to run high-performance ads.
    p We're going to set up an ad strategy from scratch for a B2B and B2C startup. Then we're going to turn this strategy into!{' '}
      span.italic REAL
      |!{' '}campaigns.
    p The exact process: Choosing platforms, making ads, A/B tests, targeting, tracking, etc.
    p I’m not an expert here. So I’m working with a!{' '}
      a(href="") specialist
      |!{' '}(whose spent millions mastering this stuff).
    p.header.thc1 3/ B2B Sales
    p
      span.italic How to acquire customers via sales
    p I'm going to teach you how to find people whose problem you solve, write emails which get replies, set up demos, and close some deals!
    p And again, it’s going to be!{' '}
      span.italic REAL
      | . Real emails. Real deals. Real rejections.
    p.header.thc2 4/ Copywriting
      span.mobileCourse &nbsp;& Landing Pages
    p
      span.italic How to communicate your product so people actually care.
    p We'll start with the fundamentals: formulas, hooks, positioning, story.

      |!{' '}Now, before I get my head down and make this…!{' '}
      span.bold three quick things
      | .

    p I want to give you!{' '}
      span.italic as much as possible in as little time as possible.
      |!{' '}New diagrams, examples, templates every 20 seconds.
    p.header.thc2 2/ It’s going to be simple
    p No marketing jargon. No unnecessary complexity. Short, sweet, step-by-step videos.
    p I’ve spent thousands of hours reading everything I can find, talking to experts, getting it wrong...!{' '}
      span.italic so you don't have to.
    //- p And I’m going to turn all those lessons into short, sweet, step-by-step videos.
    p.header.thc3 3/ It's going to be practical
    p This isn't a marketing degree. Everything is practical. We’re going to talk about it. Then I’m!{' '}
      span.italic actually going to do it.
    p.inwardSpeech I'm writing titles, running ads, making sales.
    p For!{' '}

    p.header.thc4 One last thing
    p So five years ago I was learning to code. I bought this course called Learn Node by Wes Bos.
    p The course was awesome. I still reference it today. It helped me get my first job. I used it to build this very website.
    p So I emailed Wes and told him:
    p.inwardSpeech This thing is so good it feels like my favourite album
    p Now, what I’m about to say probably sounds corny. But I don’t care. It’s completely genuine.
    p.inwardSpeech I want to give you that experience
    p I want this to be so well crafted and entertaining that it feels like!{' '}
      span.italic your marketing album.
    //- p I want you to be replaying videos for the next five years. I want it to help you get your first marketing job. I want it to help you become a CMO.
    //- p I want it to help you go from nothing to $10k MRR. And I want it to help you go way beyond that. Let's do this!
