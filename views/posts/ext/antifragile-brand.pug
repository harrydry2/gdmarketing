  h2 Lewis Capaldi
  p Last month Oasis legend Noel Gallagher decided to take a pop at up and coming music star Lewis Capaldi:
  p.inwardSpeech Music is f*****g w**k at the moment. Whose this Capaldi fella? Who the f****s that idiot!
  p Capaldi’s response was nothing short of brilliant. Performing on&nbsp;
    span.italic The Other Stage
    |&nbsp;at Glastonbury he walked out to the video of Noel Gallagher’s criticism, dressed in a bucket hat and parka (a classic Gallagher outfit),  before dedicating his performance to Noel at the end.
  p Capaldi’s entrance went viral. It got his name all over the press and social media and won him lots of new fans.

  p Gallagher responded by calling Capalidi,&nbsp;

    |. Capaldi countered by changing his Twitter photo to Chewbacca and his name to Chewis Capaldi. He was running rings around him.

  p Gallagher's words were designed to do damage. But Capaldi took ownership of them. He wore them with a badge of honor. And in doing so he became&nbsp;
    a(href="https://fs.blog/2014/04/antifragile-a-definition/" target="_blank") antifragile
    | . The more you fucked with him the stronger he got.
  h2 Understanding Antifragility
  p In plain language&nbsp;
    span.bold antifragility
    |&nbsp;is the opposite of&nbsp;
    span.bold fragility
    | .
  p If you fuck with something fragile you do damage. If you fuck with something antifragile you make it stronger. Take golf as an example. The&nbsp;
    span.bold fragile
    |&nbsp;golfer loathes the wind. The&nbsp;
    span.bold antifragile
    |&nbsp;golfer uses it to their advantage.
  p And it’s the same with brands. The majority of brands are fragile. Increases in volatility (randomness, stressors, mistakes) are a PR departments worst nightmare. Just look at Facebook’s share price in 2018.

  p But occasionally, just like Lewis Capaldi or the skilled golfer playing in the wind, brands can actually benefit from increases in randomness, stressors or mistakes.
  h2 KFC
  p Last year KFC ran out of chicken and were forced to temporarily close 700 UK branches.
  p For any fragile company such a monumental fuck up would be a complete disaster. Imagine if Apple ran out of iPhones or Honda ran out of cars. The media would start asking questions, the share price would drop, people would get fired.
  p Fortunately KFC’s response was a masterclass in PR crisis management.
  p They took out a full page apology ad in UK newspapers, showing an empty bucket of chicken, and the letters of their famous logo rearranged to read “FCK”.

  p People started to see the funny side and the ad was lauded on print and social media. Just like that an&nbsp;
    span.bold impending disaster
    |&nbsp;was spun into a&nbsp;
    span.bold positive PR story
    | .
